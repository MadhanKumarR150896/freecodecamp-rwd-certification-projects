          <li>This content is about my dog "Milo"</li>
          <li>I have uncountable learnings and emotions since his arrival from 31st Dec 2017</li>
          <li>But i would like to keep this brief because i am here with a goal to learn</li>
          <li>The amount of emotional and physical changes towards rasing a kid be it human or a pet has gone to different levels personally for me</li>
          <li>Bringing him home was one of the best decisoions i ever made</li>
          <li>Just to mention , raising a pet is not that simple like how the internet shows , it takes so much effort physically and mentally , but i embrace that journey beacuse of what it did to me</li>
